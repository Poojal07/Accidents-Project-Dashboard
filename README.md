# Accidents-Project-Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing road accident data across India. It highlights accident causes, severity, vehicle types, weather impact, and time-based trends. The dashboard provides state and city-level insights with KPIs, filters, and visuals to support data-driven road safety analysis and decision-making.

🚦 Road Accident Analysis & Safety Insights Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes road accident data across India to identify accident patterns, risk factors, and safety trends. The goal is to transform raw accident data into actionable insights that can help understand where accidents occur, why they happen, and how severe they are.

The repository includes:
📊 Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)
📁 Cleaned accident dataset
📄 Documentation for understanding the analysis

🎯 Objectives
Analyze road accidents based on cause, severity, vehicle type, and weather
Identify high-risk factors such as overspeeding and alcohol involvement
Track accident trends across years, days of the week, and locations
Provide state-wise and city-wise accident insights
Build an interactive dashboard for data-driven road safety analysis
